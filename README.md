## Hex Editor with LOTS OF COMMENTS


</div>

### Description

You know the hex read out that a hex editor would give you. It does create one of them using a hell of a lot of string manipulation and intellegnce. It is about as quick as VB would let you get and the princible can be used for just about anything envolving file manipulation, encoding, string manipulation, etc. Future versions will include a save function (easy enough to do but i dont have the time to do it now!) and the code will work in any version of VB (although you may have to copy and paste it from notepad 'cause the code was done in VB5)!
